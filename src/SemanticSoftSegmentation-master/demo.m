%% Semantic soft segmentation
% This function outputs many intermediate variables, if needed.
% The results may vary a bit from run to run, as there are 2 stages that use 
% k-means for intialization & grouping.
tic;
sss = SemanticSoftSegmentation(image, features);
toc;
% To use the features generated using our network implementation,
% just feed them as the 'features' variable to the function. It will do
% the prepocessing described in the paper and give the processed
% features as an output.
% If you are dealing with many images, storing the features after
% preprocessing is recommended as raw hyperdimensional features
% take a lot of space. Check the 'preprocessFeatures.m' file.

% Visualize

% % There's also an implementation of Spectral Matting included
